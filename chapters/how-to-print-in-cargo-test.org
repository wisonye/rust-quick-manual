* How to =println!= in =cargo test=

By default, the following =println!()= won't print to stdout:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
  #[test]
  fn test() {
      println!("Hidden output")
  }
#+END_SRC


But you can use pass =--nocapture= option to =cargo= to make that happen:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  cargo test -- --nocapture
#+END_SRC
